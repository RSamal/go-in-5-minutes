Check out the posts (and [subscribe to the newsletter](https://www.goin5minutes.com/subscribe/)) for longer explanations about concepts, tips and tricks in Go. The blog has articles about the same kinds of topics as what you see here, but with a lot more detail. And, it's a great companion to the screencasts!
